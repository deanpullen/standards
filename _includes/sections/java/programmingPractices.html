        <h1>Programming Practices</h1>
        <p>This section contains general good programming practices, that should be employed at Semantico.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="accessVariables">Providing Access to Instance and Class Variables</h2>
    <p>Don't make any instance or class variable public without good reason. Often, instance variables don't need to be
        explicitly set or gotten-often that happens as a side effect of method calls.</p>
    <h2 id="classVariablesMethods">Referring to Class Variables and Methods</h2>
    <p>Avoid using an object to access a class (static) variable or method. Use a class name instead. For example:</p>
    <figure class="pre-code">Examples:</figure>
    <pre><code class="java">
classMethod();             //OK
AClass.classMethod();      //OK
anObject.classMethod();    //AVOID!
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="contants">Constants</h2>
    <p>As a general rule, literals make code easier to read and follow. Constants should only be used when they make code easier to understand or maintain.</p>
    <p>Readability can be improved when literal values have meaning other than their literal values. For example a giant regex that parses email addresses may not be immediately obvious.</p>
    <p>Maintainability can be improved when a literal value which is likely to change is hard coded in multiple places. For example the default number of search-results per page.</p>
    <h3 id="numericalConstants">Numerical Constants</h3>
    <p>As defined above, when a numeric value is hard-coded in mulitple places, or is a 'magic number' (a number that has some meaning other than it's value) a numeric constant should be defined.</p>
    <h2 id="variableAssignments">Variable Assignments</h2>
    <p>Avoid using an object to access a class (static) variable or method. Use a class name instead. For example:</p>
    <figure class="pre-code">Avoid:</figure>
    <pre><code class="java">
fooBar.fChar = barFoo.lchar = 'c'; // AVOID!
    </code></pre>
    <p>Do not use embedded assignments in an attempt to improve run-time performance. This is the job of the compiler.
        Example:</p>
    <figure class="pre-code">Avoid:</figure>
    <pre><code class="java">
d = (a = b + c) + r;        // AVOID!
    </code></pre>
    <p>Should actually be written like:</p>
    <figure class="pre-code">Actual:</figure>
    <pre><code class="java">
a = b + c;
d = a + r;
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="parentheses">Parentheses</h2>
    <p>It is generally a good idea to use parentheses liberally in expressions involving mixed operators to avoid operator
        precedence problems.</p>
    <p>Even if the operator precedence seems clear to you, it might not be to others-you shouldn't assume that other
        programmers know precedence as well as you do.</p>
    <figure class="pre-code">Examples:</figure>
    <pre><code class="java">
if (a == b && c == d)     // AVOID!
if ((a == b) && (c == d)) // RIGHT
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="expressionsConditional">Expressions before `?' in the Conditional Operator</h2>
    <p>If an expression containing a binary operator appears before the ? in the ternary ?: operator, it should be
        parenthesized.</p>
    <figure class="pre-code">Example:</figure>
    <pre><code class="java">
(x >= 0) ? x : -x;
    </code></pre>
