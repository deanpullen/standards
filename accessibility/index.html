<h1 class="language-title">Accessibility Policy</h1>
Semantico's accessibility policy comes in two flavours: the <a href="#plain">plain version</a> and the technical version. The plain version is the one you can simply copy and paste into contracts/proposals while the technical one can be used by developers, the Support team or if you want to offer more details to a customer. 
<div id="plain" class="intro has-icon">
    <h1>Plain version</h1>
</div>
<p>Semantico aims to provide a rewarding experience for all users of the web sites we are building. For this reason we make every effort to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 requirements (Level AA). Below you can find a list of the success criteria we develop and test against. We believe that this widely supported standard ensures that the products we build are fully accessible with assistive technologies and that separate resources for disabled users should not be required. There are some exceptions which are listed further below. 
</p>
<ul><li> All pictures have an alternative text description. 
</li><li> All commands, menu items and other functions are written in plain English. 
</li><li> The website can be used without a mouse, simply by using a standard keyboard.
</li><li> The website offers jump-to links which allow visitors to jump to the main content, the main menu, the search facility and the footer. 
</li><li> The colours used in the website have sufficient contrast between them. 
</li><li> The website's layout will not break if the text size is increased or decreased using the built-in browser function to do this. 
</li><li> The website does not make use of tables for design purposes but uses them to represent normally tabulated content. 
</li><li> The website can be viewed in a logical order when all styling is turned off. 
</li><li> Any user of a screen reader software should be able to use the website's main functions without any issues.
</li><li> The website's links can be activated either by clicking on them or by using the keyboard keys and do not require JavaScript to function.
</li><li> The website will offer helpful error messages which help users recover from an error. 
</li><li> The website will provide ways to help users navigate (i.e. have a global menu), find content (i.e. have a search facility), and determine where they are (i.e include breadcrumbs or other indicators).
</li></ul>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Depending on the contents of your website or how you choose to deliver your content, there will be some exceptions to what we can test and guarantee that is accessible: 
</p>
<ul><li> We can not guarantee that embedded content (such as PDF documents or widgets) or any content provided by a third party will be accessible as they are using specific software to be displayed in the browser that we have no control over.
</li><li> We can not guarantee that the website will be accessible should you choose to include Flash-based content. 
</li><li> We cannot guarantee that the website will be accessible should you choose to include content in a way that is known to cause seizures to individuals who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy or similar disorders.
</li><li> We can not guarantee that the website will be accessible should you choose to include content which uses Scalable Vector Graphics which have not been properly tagged or the HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. 
</li><li> The website will not be accessible should you choose to display your content using images without offering a text alternative. 
</li><li> The website will not be accessible should you choose to display embedded video without offering captions or a text alternative (transcripts).
</li></ul>
<h3>Section 508</h3>
<p>Semantico does not offer support for Section 508 compliance. Section 508 requires that Federal agencies' electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. There is nothing in section 508 that requires private web sites to comply unless they are receiving federal funds or are under contract with a federal agency.

</li></ul>
<h3>Text Alternatives</h3>
<p>Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, Braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
</p>
<h4>Non-text Content</h4>
<p>All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A) 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Controls, Input:</b>  If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. 
</li><li> <b>Test:</b>  If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. 
</li><li> <b>Sensory:</b>  If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. 
</li><li> <b>CAPTCHA:</b> If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
</li><li> <b>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible:</b> If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.
</li></ul>
<h3>Adaptable</h3>
<p>Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
</p>
<h4>Info and Relationships</h4>
<p>Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Meaningful Sequence</h4>
<p>When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Sensory Characteristics</h4>
<p>Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. (Level A)
</p>
<h3>Distinguishable</h3>
<p>Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
</p>
<h4>Use of Colour</h4>
<p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)
<i>Note:</i> This success criterion addresses colour perception specifically.
</p>
<h4>Contrast (Minimum)</h4>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Large Text:</b> Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
</li><li> <b>Incidental:</b>  Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
</li><li> <b>Logotypes:</b>  Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.
</li></ul>
<h4>Resize text</h4>
<p>Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality. (Level AA)
</p>
<h4>Images of Text</h4>
<p>If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following: (Level AA)
</p>
<ul><li> Customisable: The image of text can be visually customised to the user's requirements;
</li><li> Essential: A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.
</li></ul>
<p><i>Note:</i> Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.
</p>
<h3>Keyboard Accessible</h3>
<p>Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
</p>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)
</p><p><i>Note 1:</i> This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
<i>Note 2:</i> This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.
</p>
<h4>No Keyboard Trap</h4>
<p>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)
</p><p><i>Note:</i> Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
</p>
<h3>Enough Time</h3>
<p>Provide users enough time to read and use content.
</p>
<h4>Timing Adjustable</h4>
<p>For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: (Level A) 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Turn off:</b> The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or 
</li><li> <b>Adjust:</b> The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
</li><li> <b>Extend:</b> The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
</li><li> <b>Real-time Exception:</b> The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
</li><li> <b>Essential Exception:</b> The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or 
</li><li> <b>20 Hour Exception:</b> The time limit is longer than 20 hours. 
</li></ul>
<p><i>Note:</i> This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with  Success Criterion 3.2.1, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.
</p>
<h4>Pause, Stop, Hide</h4>
<p>For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true: (Level A) 
</p>
<ul><li> Moving, blinking, scrolling: For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
</li><li> Auto-updating: For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.
</li></ul>
<p><i>Note 1:</i> For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to the Seizure section below. 
</p><p><i>Note 2:</i> Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. 
</p><p><i>Note 3:</i> Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so. 
</p><p><i>Note 4:</i> An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.
</p>
<h3>Seizures</h3>
<p>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures. 
</p>
<h4>Three Flashes or Below Threshold</h4>
<p>Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds. (Level A) 
</p><p><i>Note:</i> Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
</p>
<h3>Navigable</h3>
<p>Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
</p>
<h4>Bypass Blocks</h4>
<p>A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages. (Level A) 
</p>
<h4>Page Titled</h4>
<p>Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. (Level A) 
</p>
<h4>Focus Order</h4>
<p>If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Link Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Multiple Ways</h4>
<p>More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a process. (Level AA)
</p>
<h4>Headings and Labels</h4>
<p>Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. (Level AA)
</p>
<h4>Focus Visible</h4>
<p>Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible. (Level AA)
</p>
<h3>Readable</h3>
<p>Make text content readable and understandable.
</p>
<h4>Language of Page</h4>
<p>The default human language of each Web page can be programmatically determined. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Language of Parts</h4>
<p>The human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text. (Level AA)
</p>
<h3>Predictable</h3>
<p>Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
</p>
<h4>On Focus</h4>
<p>When any component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context. (Level A) 
</p>
<h4>On Input</h4>
<p>Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component. (Level A) 
</p>
<h4>Consistent Navigation</h4>
<p>Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user. (Level AA)
</p>
<h4>Consistent Identification</h4>
<p>Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently. (Level AA)
</p>
<h3>Input Assistance</h3>
<p>Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
</p>
<h4>Error Identification</h4>
<p>If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Labels or Instructions</h4>
<p>Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input. (Level A)
</p>
<h4>Error Suggestion</h4>
<p>If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardise the security or purpose of the content. (Level AA)
</p>
<h4>Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)</h4>
<p>For Web pages that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true: (Level AA) 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Reversible:</b>  Submissions are reversible.
</li><li> <b>Checked:</b>  Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
</li><li> <b>Confirmed:</b>  A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.
</li></ul>
<h3>Compatible</h3>
<p>Maximise compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
</p>
<h4>Parsing</h4>
<p>In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features. (Level A) 
</p><p><i>Note:</i> Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.
</p>
