<h1 class="language-title">Accessibility Policy</h1>
Semantico's accessibility policy comes in two flavours: the plain version and the technical version. The plain version is the one you can simply copy and paste into contracts/proposals while the technical one can be used by developers, the Support team or if you want to offer more details to a customer.
